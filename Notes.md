# LSB-Notes
A Chrome OS exploit that allows you to remove extensions (Only for Chrome OS). Also can Install extensions and remove permissions.

## How it Works 
This will work like a bootable USB that runs scripts into the computer (Shimboot & BadApple Utilities uses this method). There will be scripts to: Remove Extensions (LightSpeed), Add extensions, Remove/Edit Policies, Remove Permissions (Admin Lock), Become Admin, and access other features. 

## How to install 

When I make the file public; 
1: You can use the chromebook recovery utility Chrome Extension (or any other like rufus). 
2: Then put it into a USB. 
3: Press "Esc + Refresh + Power" and go into Dev Mode (CTRL + D > Enter) 
4: Plug in the USB and let it load the menu.
